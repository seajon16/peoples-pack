# The People's Pack v1.5

This is a bunch of random Minecraft Forge mods for #epic gamers, including Create, IE, Rats, and Tetra.

## What's New in v1.5?

Super cool end, animals (hopefully), QoL mods, and chunk loading!

* New Mods:
  * [Alex's Mobs](https://media.forgecdn.net/files/3213/812/alexsmobs-1.6.0.jar)
    * Adds a bunch of cool biome-specific mobs
  * [AI Improvements](https://media.forgecdn.net/files/3031/978/AI-Improvements-1.16.2-0.3.0.jar)
    * QoL: Improvements to AI that improves both client-side and server-side performance
  * [Better End](https://media.forgecdn.net/files/3209/506/betterendforge-1.16.4-1.5.0.jar)
    * Makes the end extremely cool
  * [Client Tweaks](https://media.forgecdn.net/files/3222/131/ClientTweaks_1.16.3-5.3.0.jar)
    * QoL: Various client improvements
  * [Controlling](https://media.forgecdn.net/files/3200/753/Controlling-7.0.0.13.jar)
    * QoL: Allows searching of client-side settings
  * [Cosmetic Armor Reworked](https://media.forgecdn.net/files/3205/904/CosmeticArmorReworked-1.16.5-v1b.jar)
    * Allows you to have cosmetic armor, or hide your armor altogether
  * [FriendlyFire](https://media.forgecdn.net/files/3183/918/FriendlyFire-1.16.5-7.0.1.jar)
    * QoL: Prevents you from hitting your pets
  * [FTB Chunks](https://media.forgecdn.net/files/3189/22/ftb-chunks-1604.2.2.62.jar) (requires [FTB GUI Library](https://media.forgecdn.net/files/3214/262/ftb-gui-library-1605.2.1.40-forge.jar) & [Architectury](https://media.forgecdn.net/files/3218/917/architectury-1.8.128-forge.jar))
    * Plot claiming & chunk loading
    * **NOTE:** This mod adds a minimap. Since this modpack already has Xaero's minimap, you probably want to disable it. You can do this by hitting `m` ingame (the default keybinding), then clicking on the `minimap` option until it reads `disabled`.
  * [Patchouli](https://media.forgecdn.net/files/3204/37/Patchouli-1.16.4-50.jar)
    * Adds better documentation for mods, namely Better End
  * [Swing Through Grass](https://media.forgecdn.net/files/3103/28/swingthroughgrass-1.16.4-1.5.3.jar)
    * QoL: Lets you hit mobs through grass
* Updates to Mods:
  * [Absent by Design](https://media.forgecdn.net/files/3213/954/absentbydesign-1.16.5-1.4.1.jar)
  * [AutoOreDictConv](https://media.forgecdn.net/files/3212/354/autooredictconv-1.16.4-16.1.8.jar)
  * [Citadel](https://media.forgecdn.net/files/3220/917/citadel-1.6.2.jar)
  * [JEI](https://media.forgecdn.net/files/3192/904/jei-1.16.4-7.6.1.71.jar)
  * [MouseTweaks](https://media.forgecdn.net/files/3202/662/MouseTweaks-2.14-mc1.16.2.jar)
  * [RandomPatches](https://media.forgecdn.net/files/3211/323/randompatches-2.4.4-forge.jar)
  * [Tetra](https://media.forgecdn.net/files/3201/109/tetra-1.16.4-3.6.1.jar)
  * [Torchmaster](hhttps://media.forgecdn.net/files/3170/451/torchmaster-2.3.6.jar)
  * [Waystones](https://media.forgecdn.net/files/3222/129/Waystones_1.16.5-7.4.0.jar)
  * [Xaero's Minimap (via its own site)](https://chocolateminecraft.com/mods2/minimap/Xaeros_Minimap_21.4.1_Forge_1.16.5.jar)
  * [Xaero's World Map (also via its own site)](https://chocolateminecraft.com/mods2/worldmap/XaerosWorldMap_1.12.1_Forge_1.16.5.jar)
* Bugfixes:
  * The latest version of Forge does not work with Tetra (see [this issue](https://github.com/mickelus/tetra/issues/365)), therefore the instructions now point to downloading Forge v36.0.40, the latest working version

To update your pack, you can simply delete the contents of your `mods` folder, then unzip the new version into your `mods` folder, or you can download the individual mods below.
In addition, if you were experiencing a crash when booting the game, you'll also need to re-follow all the installation instructions, since you'll need to download a specific version of Forge to fix the crash.

**NOTE:** FTB Chunks adds a minimap. Since this modpack already has Xaero's minimap, you probably want to disable it. You can do this by hitting `m` ingame (the default keybinding), then clicking on the `minimap` option until it reads `disabled`.

## Installation

* Download and run [this launcher](https://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/1.16.5-36.0.40/forge-1.16.5-36.0.40-installer.jar); you'll want a client installation.
* This should make a `mods` folder in your `.minecraft` folder (which is usually in `C:\Users\{User}\AppData\Roaming`), but if it doesn't, start up the Minecraft launcher, select the new forge profile, and run the game.
Once it loads, close it, and the `mods` folder should now be present.

* Lastly, you need the mods.
You can either download [the zip in this repo](./peoples-pack-v1.5.zip) (it includes OptiFine `;)`) and unzip the contents into your `mods` folder, or download each of these and throw them individually into your `mods` folder:

Launch Minecraft, and you should be good to go.

## About

As a disclaimer, this isn't a perfect representation of the modded Minecraft experience.
If you were to use a different, properly maintained pack, like any from [the FTB Team](https://feed-the-beast.com/), you'd have a much cleaner experience.
This is just me throwing together some packs that I think play nicely with each other.

If you're using my server to play this pack, I also have [these datapacks](https://vanillatweaks.net/share#KK8V5D) from [Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks/) installed.
You don't need to install these yourself, since they're all server-side, but I'm leaving there here in case you want to learn more about them:
* Experimental
  * Confetti creepers
* Hermitcraft
  * Wandering trades
* Mobs
  * Villager death messages
  * Double shulker shells
  * Dragon drops
* Items
  * Player head drops
  * Armored elytra
* Survival
  * Villager workstation highlights
  * Multiplayer sleep
  * Graves
  * Custom nether portals
  * Armor statues
  * Unlock all recipes
  * Fast leaf decay
  * Cauldron concrete

In addition, I have [the end city datapack](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/end-city-for-better-end-forge-port/) for the Better End mod.

## Notes for Server Admins

* I recommend changing IE's configuration to not generate copper, since Create also creates copper, and the two are compatible
  * If you don't do this, you can edit AODC's config file to automatically convert copper of one type to the other to make player's lives easier
* To use Biomes O' Plenty, you need to set the `level-type` in `server.properties` to `biomesoplenty`
* I highly recommend [FTB Backups](https://media.forgecdn.net/files/3038/811/ftb-backups-2.1.1.6.jar)
